Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _RES.3-003 Learn to Build Your Own Videogame with Unity Game Engine and Microsoft Kinect_ as it was taught by Kyle Keane and Andrew Ringler in IAP 2017.

This course was a 9-day hands-on workshop about designing, building, and publishing simple educational videogames. Participants learned about videogame creation using the Unity game engine, collaborative software development using GitHub, gesture handling using Microsoft Kinect, 3D digital object creation, videogame design, and small team management.

The course was offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the end of the month.

Course Outcomes
---------------

*   Learn fundamentals of videogame creation using the Unity game engine
*   Become familiar with collaborative software development using GitHub

{{< quote "Technical skills take a long time to develop; you can’t turn people into developers in two weeks. But you can teach life skills in that time, so one of our goals for this experience is for participants to leave the workshop valuing themselves as learners." "— Kyle Keane and Andrew Ringler" >}}
