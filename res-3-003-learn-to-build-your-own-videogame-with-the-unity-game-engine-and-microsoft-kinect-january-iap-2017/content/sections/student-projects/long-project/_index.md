A group thinking of game ideas. This is the early planning stage of "Jedi Ball," a mind controlled bowling game. (Courtesy of MIT OpenCourseWare.)

Overview
--------

Students form groups of three to four and work for twenty hours on a long project. We help facilitate this by discussing techniques for collaborative design, guiding the class in an improv activity, lead a brainstorming activity for the whole class to help students identify collaborators, allow students ample time to self-organize into teams. Students then have twenty hours of class time to develop an idea for a videogame, to create the game, and to prepare to present about their game in front of external visitors. The capstone of the class is a final five-minute presentation that each group must give about their game in front of the entire class and external visitors.
