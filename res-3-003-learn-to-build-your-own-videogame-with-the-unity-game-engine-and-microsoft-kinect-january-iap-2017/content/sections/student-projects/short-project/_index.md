A group working on Goshzilla, a godzilla themed game, succeeds at making the character model mimic a person's motions. (Courtesy of MIT OpenCourseWare.)

Overview
--------

Students form groups of two to three and work for six hours on a small project. We help facilitate this by discussing techniques for collaborative design, guiding the class in an improv activity, lead a brainstorming activity for the whole class to help students identify collaborators, allow students ample time to self-organize into teams. Students then have six hours of class time to develop an idea for a small videogame, to create the game, to discover if they like their teammates, and to learn about all the technical skills that will be needed on a team to succeed. Each group does a short presentation for the entire class and talks about their game, but most importantly talks about what they learned.
